## Introduction

Dive into the world of music with our Spotify Clone, a web application that simulates the core experiences of Spotify, one of the leading music streaming platforms. This project aims to replicate the look and feel of Spotify, incorporating key functionalities that allow users to enjoy a simplified version of the music streaming service. Although not a full-fledged replica, this clone offers a glimpse into the potential of modern web technologies in recreating sophisticated web applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro:** Utilized for creating fast, modern websites with a seamless view transition experience, enhancing the overall user interface and interaction.
- **React:** A cornerstone technology for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces, facilitating the interactive elements of the application.
- **HTML & CSS:** The foundation for crafting the application's structure and style, ensuring accessibility and a visually engaging user experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Adopted for its utility-first approach to CSS, enabling rapid UI development and a cohesive look across the application.
- **JavaScript (JS):** Vanilla JS is used to add interactivity and control the playback logic, volume, and track selection functionalities.

## Features

- **Audio Playback:** Users can play audio tracks, experiencing smooth playback controls akin to the original Spotify platform.
- **Volume Control:** The application offers a volume control feature, allowing users to adjust the playback volume to their liking.
- **Album Tracklist:** Access the list of songs in an album, providing users with the option to select and play any track from the list.
- **Playback Indicator:** A visual indicator is present above the album cover to show which album is currently being played.
- **Play/Pause Functionality:** Users can play or pause tracks. Resuming a track continues the playback from where it was left off, ensuring a seamless listening experience.
